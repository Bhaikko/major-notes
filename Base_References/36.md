## Geometric deep learning on graphs and manifolds

```
proposes a unified framework allowing to generalize CNN arch
to non euclidean domains
```

### Introduction
```
3D objects are traditionally modelled as Riemannian manifolds
```

### Input 
```
For all shapes, point-wise 544 dimensinoal SHOT descriptors(local
histogram of normal vectors)[54] were used as input data
```
