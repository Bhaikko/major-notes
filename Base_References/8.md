## Geometric Deep learning
```
meshed surfaces in graphics are studied under Non euclidean space

purpose of paper is to overview different examples of geometric deep learning problems
```

### Introduction
```
Direct Cnn cannot be applied as they depend on Eucledian Geometry
Basic operations like convolution that are taken for granted in the euclidean case are not well defined on no eucledian

Show different methods of translating key ingredients of succ. deep 
learning methods such as CNN to non eucledian
```

```
Focus of paper is learning functions on non Euclidean structured domains and attempts to generalize the popular CNNs to such settings
```

### Computer Graphics Section
```
The reason we convert to voxel data or depth images as they are
euclidean representations which may lose fine details
