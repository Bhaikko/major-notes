### NOTES ###
SCAPE model used to fit input human body scan and 
rig the input scan by transferring the high quality rigging from SCAPE model.
Limited to human bodies

Does Rigging and Interactive avatar reshaping
Too much linear algebra ig.

Limited to humanoids only, not even human-like characters

Input: Set of Vertices, Triangles and Joints

Mine Paper 2

### NOTES ###
Skeleton is cycle free graph whose nodes are joints and bones are edges
Considers modelling and rigging as same step. Unify the step and introduce algo for sketch based modelling by parts that mainatain a rigged mesh at all times

generates rigged mesh, surface skeleton and skin weights for each part and update it as parts are merged

uses pinocchio too. Uses modified douglas peucker algo for rigging(Cylindrical douglas peukar)
douglas finds salient points of the chordal axis.

uses OpenMesh and CHOLMOD
Nothing really special in future work

### Notes ###
curve skeletons as geometric input feature to stacked hourglass network
medial surface of object mesh used

uses Volumetics CNNs with Stacked hourglass and introducing knowledge as an additonal geometric input

pose estimation closely correlates to pose estimation

model dataset mentioned in the paper. The skeleton for each model obtained from blender plugin (Section 4)

### FUTURE WORK ###
More accurate representation of the mesh topology should provide models with
a better understanding of the medial surface, which in turn will make deep learning models
such as the Stacked Hourglass Network more accurate.

Suggesting k-fold cross validation

.. Didnt read the background and related work section
Volumetric CNNs exist for 3d data

output of Network joined using Prim's algo

input as voxelized mesh using Binvox
