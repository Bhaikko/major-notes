## Rotation invariant spherical harmonic representation

proposes a rotation invariant harmonic to decide similarity between objects

Transforms rotation dependent shape descriptors 
into rotation independent ones

Many of the descriptors that have used PCA alignment represent
3D shape as either spherical function or voxel grid
