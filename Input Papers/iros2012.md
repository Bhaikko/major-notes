## 3D descriptors for Object and category recoginitoin
*Algos available as Lib*
*Contains many descriptors too*

```
describe existing feature extraction algos
increasing the number of keypoints improve recognition results 
at expense of size and time
```

### Pipeline
```
input clouds are fed to keypoint extraction algo. 
keypoints are obtained using algo like Harris3D keypoint extractor
descriptors are obtained on the extracted keypoint and thes form a 
set that is used to represent the input cloud

```


### Descriptors
*output dimensions mentioned*
* Shape Index
* Rotation invariant
* Point Feature Histogram
* Fast Point Feature histograms
* SHOT descriptor
* Principal curvature estimations

```
parameter for some descriptors are used as default
```

### conclusion
* increasing number of keypoints imporves revognition results at expense of size and time
* SHOT COLOR descriptor presents a good balance between recognition performance and time complexity
