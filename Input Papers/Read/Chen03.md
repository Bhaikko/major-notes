## On visual similarity
```
a visual similarity based 3D model retrieval system is proposed

Zernike moments and Fourier descriptors as features
http://3d.csie.ntu.edu.tw   ## Dead link

two geometry based approach
1. shape based: uses distribution of vertices
2. topology based: uses topological structure
```

### Feature extraction
```
Light field descriptor used for extracting features
similarity between two 3D models can be measured by summing up similarity from all correspponding images of light field
