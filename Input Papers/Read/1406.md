## Deep representation for Volumateric shapes
```
3D ShapeNets to represent a geometric 3D shape as a probabilistic distribution of binary variables on a 3D voxel grid.
```

### Introduction
```
3D shape not used due to lack of good generic representation of 3D shapes
Generic shape representation for object category recognition
```
```
Each 3D mesh is presented as binary tensor:
    1 indicates the voxel is inside the mesh surface
    0 indicates the voxel is outside the mesh
    30x30x30 grid size

A 3D shape is represented as 24x24x24 voxel grid with 3 extra cells of padding in both directions
