## Evaluation of local shape descriptor
*This paper has many local descriptors mentioned which felt simple*
*Contains rich details about local descriptor in Literature review*

```
systematically evaluate collection of local shape descriptors.

both local and global descriptor uses a single vector
local shape descriptor describes the local surface region around a number of sample points on an object

sample points are chosen from collection of M models. A local descriptor is calculated at each point

We have found that mean curvature, shape index, and
curvature index are the best descriptor
```

```
can use the combined two local descriptors as mentioned in paper
uses its own method to combine two descriptors

Different descriptor and several salient point detetion methods are used to choose sample points

global descriptors are often not invariant to rotation, scale, etc
```

### Experiments
```
descriptors are sampled across small aread surrounding each vertex P. Sampling points algo in Calculation method

PCA is applied across vectors from all vertices on all objects in the dataset to keep data comparable after reduction. All vectors are re-projected onto this new coordinate system and values in each dimension are normalized to [0, 1].

```
For every salient point, performance metric, etc calculation, code referenced at end of section
```
* 3D Harris rings gave the best performance, parameters mentioned in paper
500 uniform random points are considered for meshes

* Best descriptor were mean curvature, shape index and curvature index in bag of words
* Overall, normal distribution being mose discriminative and stable
* normal dis and shape index at same sample points performed best
* combining the same sample points performs better
* salient point improve performance when number of sample points is small
